# SpotiPlayerMini

-----------------Why-----------------
1. It isn't reinventing the wheel, it's an attempt at innovation
2. Practice on my skills in areas where I have little experience
    a. User interfaces (tkinter)
    b. API Integration
3. It's something I've wanted personally for a while, since there are few other *good* alternatives
4. It's fun to create!
